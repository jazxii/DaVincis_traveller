## TITLE: DaVincis_traveller

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
We often forget things to carry when we are going on a trip. To tackle this problem. 
Create a solution to help passengers maintain a checklist depending on the type of trip.

## INSPIRATION: 
Traveling is one of the most common and beloved hobby for a lot of people. It so happens that most of the times,
people plan for hours about their long awaited trip but due to the rush of the final hour and the lack of a reminder/alarm system often important stuff are missed out.
Thus to tackle such a problem which everyone experiences in their life and make travel easy and fun we come up with our proposal.

## FUNCTIONALITY:
A simple sign in feature appears when u begin the app and after proceeding with it the travel destiation and duration is asked. The weather conditions are 
displayed to the user during his stay and a checklist appears requesting the user to choose the type of visit, i.e business or leisure or both. This proceeds to a new checklist
which is the activity section, where the user is asked to fill in the boxes the activities he is intending to do. On checking in each activity a list is provided which shows
the required items for that activity and the user can check the items provided and also delete present items or add new items to the list. An additional feature is added
which shows the user nearby popular restaurants or places to visit.

## DEVELOPMENT: 

(HOW TO RUN IT LOGICALLY):

## CHALLENGES: 
- In Connecting Database as a user
- SignIn Auth Crashes

## ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
- Created a Basic Workig app
- Learned more on Real Time database
- UI base design and more
- 

## WHAT WE LEARNED:
We need more practice before going to hacks, PEACE!! :)
